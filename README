Instructions for compiling the NIMS plugin:
 1. Go here to find out the latest release of Adium: 
    http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/GettingReleaseAdiumSource
 2. Do an svn checkout to get it, putting it somewhere like adium-1.3.2
 3. Make a symlink to it:  ln -s adium-1.3.2 adium-release 
 4. Compile Adium, either in xcode or from the command line: 
    Xcode: open adium-release/Adium.xcodeproj
      Select "Development" as the build configuration.
        and build it.
    Cmd line: Edit adium-release/Makefile as follows:
      Change this line:
        DEFAULT_BUILDCONFIGURATION=Deployment-Debug
      To this:
        DEFAULT_BUILDCONFIGURATION=Development
      And then run "make adium".
    You now have the latest adium source compiled and can link to it in your 
    plugin.
 5. Copy NIMSplugin/NIMSplugin.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj.template to 
         NIMSplugin/NIMSplugin.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
    and grep for "dreeves", changing to your path to adium-release.
 6. Open the plugin project in xcode:
    open NIMSplugin/NIMSplugin.xcodeproj
 7. Build it.

--- Deploy latest version to yootles.com ---

run deploy.sh  (NB: you have to be in the nims directory to run this)

For refactoring (this is kinda awesome):
./codemod.py --extensions h,m 'regexMatchingOldThing' 'whatToChangeItTo'

SCHEDULED FOR DELETION:

from the original deploy instructions:
  open NIMSplugin.xcodeproj and edit active target build settings.
under the build tab, right click on the target (Debug/Release) and 
select "edit configurations". At the very bottom of the edit window
you can set which target configuration command line builds use.
=> set this to use the Release version.
